    The Data Room is on the right side of your screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag and drop your file">
    Drop your Excel file into the Data Room.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    Apers will read and understand the structure and logic of your model automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Apers Understands

When you upload a model, Apers learns:

- The overall structure
- How formulas connect to each other
- The logic behind calculations
- Sub-models and their relationships

This means you can ask questions or make changes without explaining everything from scratch.

## Checking for Errors

Apers can audit your models to find mistakes.

**Example instructions:**
- "Check this model for formula errors"
- "Find any broken links in this spreadsheet"
- "Audit this proforma for calculation mistakes"

<Info>
  This is useful for models your firm created in the past. Apers helps make sure they're error-tight before you use them again.

## Asking Questions About Your Model

Once uploaded, you can ask Apers anything about the spreadsheet:

- "How is the IRR calculated?"
- "What assumptions drive the cash flow?"
- "Explain the debt schedule"

Apers will answer based on what it learned from your file.
