Before Apers makes changes to your spreadsheet, it shows you exactly what it plans to do. You stay in control.

## How Apers Thinks

When you give Apers a task, it first creates a plan. You can see:

- **Thinking process**: How Apers is strategizing the model
- **Planned changes**: Which cells it will update, create, or change
- **Content preview**: The numbers and formulas Apers will use

This transparency lets you review everything before it happens.

## Approval Options

After Apers shows its plan, you choose what to do:

<ResponseField name="Approve" type="action">
  Approves this single update. Apers will make the change and then pause for your next approval.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Always Approve" type="action">
  Gives Apers full autonomy. It will execute all changes without pausing—this is called **Fast Mode**.

  <Warning>
    Fast Mode can use more credits than expected. Recommended for Pro and Enterprise users with sufficient credits.
  </Warning>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Reject" type="action">
  Stops Apers from making the change. You can type a reason explaining why, and Apers will adjust its approach.
</ResponseField>

## When to Reject

Sometimes Apers might:

- Misunderstand your instructions
- Use different assumptions than you expected
- Change something you wanted to keep

Just click **Reject**, type your feedback, and Apers will try again with your guidance.

<Info>
  Rejecting with a clear reason helps Apers learn what you want for the rest of the task.
