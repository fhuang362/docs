Apers can build spreadsheets from scratch and clean up messy data for you.

## Creating Spreadsheets from Scratch

Tell Apers what you need, and it will build a spreadsheet with dynamic formulas.

- Proforma models
- Asset management trackers
- Portfolio management spreadsheets
- Any custom model you describe

  <Step title="Describe your model">
    Type what you want in the Chat box. For example: "Create a multifamily proforma for a 50-unit apartment."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload supporting documents (optional)">
    Drag and drop rent rolls, OMs, LPAs, or other documents into the Data Room. Apers will use this information in your model.

## Using Unstructured Documents

Apers understands scanned and unstructured documents. You can upload:

- Offering memorandums (OMs)
- Limited partnership agreements (LPAs)
- Other legal or financial documents

Apers extracts the key information and uses it to build your model.
