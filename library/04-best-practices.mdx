Get the most out of your Library with these tips.

## Name Files Clearly

Use descriptive names so you and your team can find files easily.

| Instead of...         | Use...                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Model_v2.xlsx         | Multifamily Proforma Template.xlsx  |
| Assumptions.xlsx      | 2024 Market Assumptions - Texas.xlsx|
| Template.docx         | LOI Template - Acquisition.docx     |

## Save Often

Every time you build something useful, save it to the Library.

**Good candidates to save:**
- A model you'll use again
- Market assumptions you researched
- Templates your firm uses regularly
- Files you improved or cleaned up

## Keep Files Updated

When you improve a model or template, save the new version to the Library. This keeps your firm working with the best versions.

<Info>
  Consider adding version numbers or dates to file names when you update them.

## Organize by Type

Group similar files together:

- **Models**: Proformas, underwriting templates, portfolio trackers
- **Templates**: LOIs, memos, reports
- **Assumptions**: Market data, cap rates, rent comps

## Share with Your Team

The Library is firm-wide. When you save something useful, your whole team benefits.

**Encourage your team to:**
- Save their best work
- Use existing templates instead of starting from scratch
- Update files when they find improvements
