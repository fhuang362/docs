There are two ways to add files to your Library: upload directly or save from a Chat or Deal.

## Upload Directly

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Library">
    Click the **Library** tab on the left side panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your files">
    Drag and drop files directly into the Library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This is useful for files you already have, like existing templates or models from your firm.

## Save from a Chat or Deal

As you work, you can push files from any Chat or Deal into the Library.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your file">
    Locate the file in the Data Room within your Chat or Deal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the triple-dot icon">
    Click the **⋮** icon next to the file name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save to Library">
    Click **Save to Library**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The file is now available for all future Chats and Deals.

<Info>
  This is a powerful way to capture your work. Every time you build something useful, save it to the Library for later.

## What Happens After Saving

Once saved, your file appears in the Library. You and your team can:

- Access it anytime from the Library tab
- Import it into any future Chat or Deal
- Use it as a starting point for new work
