A Deal is a project folder that contains all your relevant chats and files for a specific real estate opportunity.

## What is a Deal?

Think of a Deal as a workspace for one investment opportunity. It keeps everything organized in one place:

- All your sub-chats (research, modeling, analysis)
- All your deal files (rent rolls, OMs, LPAs, spreadsheets)
- Your attached Playbooks (investment criteria)
- Generated summaries and market data
