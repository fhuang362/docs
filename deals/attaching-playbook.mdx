When you attach a Playbook to a deal, Apers uses your investment strategy as background information for all analysis.

## What Happens When You Attach a Playbook

Once a Playbook is attached:

- All existing sub-chats gain access to the Playbook
- All new sub-chats automatically use the Playbook
- Apers reads deal information through the lens of your investment strategy

**Example:**

If you attach a Core Plus investment thesis Playbook, the entire Apers system for this deal will analyze everything based on Core Plus criteria.

## How to Attach a Playbook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your deal">
    Go to the deal you want to work with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Run Playbook">
    Click the **Run Playbook** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your Playbook">
    Choose from your existing Playbooks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Playbook is active">
    The Playbook is now attached to this deal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Swapping Playbooks

You can change the attached Playbook anytime.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Run Playbook">
    Click the **Run Playbook** button again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a different Playbook">
    Choose a new Playbook from your list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="New Playbook is active">
    Apers now uses the new investment strategy for this deal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Swapping Playbooks is useful when you want to analyze the same deal under different investment criteria—for example, comparing a Core Plus strategy vs. a Value-Add strategy.
