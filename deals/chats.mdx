A deal can contain many sub-chats. Each sub-chat is a separate conversation, but they all share the same Data Room.

## How Sub-Chats Work

- Each sub-chat is its own conversation with Apers
- All sub-chats can access files in the deal's Data Room
- All sub-chats can use the deal's attached Playbooks

## Chat Isolation

<Warning>
  Chats are siloed. Chat A cannot directly reference Chat B.
</Warning>

This is intentional. It prevents cross-conversation contamination and keeps your analysis clean.

**Why this matters:**
- Each chat stays focused on its task
- No confusion from mixing different analyses
- Cleaner context for Apers to work with

## Sharing Information Between Chats

Even though chats can't directly talk to each other, you can still pass information between them using the Data Room.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export from Chat A">
    In your first chat, ask Apers to export results to the Data Room. For example: "Export this market research summary to the Data Room."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Chat B">
    Create a new sub-chat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference the export">
    In the new chat, tell Apers to use the exported file. For example: "Use the market research file to build a proforma."
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research in Subchat 1">
    Conduct market research to understand market assumptions. Export your findings to the Data Room.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model in Subchat 2">
    Start a new subchat. Build a proforma using the exported market research.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review in Subchat 3">
    Start another subchat. Run an error check on the proforma you created.
  </Step>
</Steps>
