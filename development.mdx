In Apers, there are two ways to analyze deals: **Chat** and **Deals**.

|               | Chat                             | Deal                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**   | Quick research and analysis      | Comprehensive deal management                     |
| **Structure** | Standalone conversation          | Contains multiple chats + all deal-relevant files |
| **Best for**  | Fast exploration, quick modeling | Committed, in-depth deal analysis                 |

<Info>
  A Chat can be converted into a Deal if you decide to commit further to a deal.

## Starting with a Quick Chat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a quick chat">
    Click **"Start a quick chat"** to begin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your files">
    Upload deal information into the **Data Room** on the right side by dragging and dropping. Apers understands all your files automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start working">
    Start chatting, working, and modeling from the **Chat Box** on the left side.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Converting a Chat to a Deal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the + button">
    Move your cursor to the **Convert to Deal button**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert to deal">
    Click **"Convert to deal"** and your Deal will be created.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating a Deal Directly

Alternatively, click **"Create a deal"** instead of starting a quick chat. This allows you to:

- Systematically input key deal attributes (name, address, additional information)
- Upload files
- Attach **Playbooks** (your investment preferences and investment thesis)

## Working with Subchats

Under a Deal, you can create as many subchats as needed. All subchats share the Deal's Data Room.

<Info>
  This approach allows you to work beyond the typical context window limitations, which is essential for complex real estate deals.

**Example workflow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research in Subchat 1">
    Conduct market research to understand market assumptions, then export your findings to the Data Room.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Model in Subchat 2">
    Start a new subchat and begin modeling using the exported data by telling Apers to retrieve it.
  </Step>
