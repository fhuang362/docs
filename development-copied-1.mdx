Playbook is a powerful feature that allows users to:

1. **Formalize their investment thesis** — Make better decisions over time with clearly defined criteria
2. **Simulate counterparty preferences** — Understand prospects' or counterparties' investment preferences and simulate their possible actions

<Info>
  Playbooks can be updated as you analyze more deals. In future versions of Apers, Playbooks will be able to improve automatically.
