## Get started in five steps

Create your first spreadsheet model and turn it into a Deal workspace.

### Step 1: Create a Quick Chat

<Accordion title="Start a new Quick Chat" icon="message">
  From your Apers dashboard, click **New Chat** to create a Quick Chat. This is your starting point for building or uploading spreadsheet models.
</Accordion>

### Step 2: Interact with Excel Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a new spreadsheet" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Ask Apers to build one for you. For example:

    `"Build me a sample pro forma in spreadsheet"`

    Apers will generate a spreadsheet model based on your request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upload an existing spreadsheet" icon="upload">
    Drag and drop your spreadsheet file into the **Data Room** on the right side of the chat.

    <Tip>
      Apers supports Excel files (.xlsx and .xlsm) and CSV files.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Document Ingestion

<Accordion title="Wait for Ready status" icon="circle-check">
  Apers understands your document as soon as it's uploaded. However, for best results—especially with complicated tasks—wait for the notification to turn **green** and show **"Ready"**.

  <Tip>
    Full ingestion allows Apers to cross-reference all your files accurately when tasks are complex.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Build or Update Your Model

<Accordion title="Interact with your spreadsheet" icon="table">
  Once your document is ready, you can interact with Apers to:

  - Build new models
  - Update existing models
  - Perform real-time modeling with Dynamic Formulas
</Accordion>

### Step 5: Convert to a Deal

<Accordion title="Turn your chat into a Deal workspace" icon="folder-open">
  When you're ready to commit more to this work:

  1. Click the **"Convert to Deal"** button at the top of the page
  2. Your Quick Chat becomes a Deal workspace
  3. Create multiple sub-chats within the Deal to perform more complex tasks

  <Tip>
    A Deal workspace keeps all your deal-relevant documents organized in one place.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>
