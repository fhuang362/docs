Apers has a powerful unstructured data ingestion engine built specifically for real estate documents, including scanned files, unstructured PDFs, and CSV spreadsheets.

## How to Upload Files

Uploading files to Apers is simple:

1. Navigate to the uploading section of the system
2. Drag and drop your files directly into the upload area
3. Apers will automatically begin processing your files

<Tip>
You can upload multiple files at once. Apers will process each file individually and display its status.
</Tip>

## File Processing Statuses

Once uploaded, Apers processes your files through several stages. You can track progress by viewing the status of each file:

<ResponseField name="Uploaded" type="status">
  The file has been uploaded to Apers but has not been processed.

  This typically occurs when a new file is created by Apers directly. AI-generated files are not automatically incorporated into processing unless you specifically click **Summarize** from the triple-dot icon (⋮).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Preparing" type="status">
  The system is analyzing the file to understand what it is and determining its data type.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Parsing" type="status">
  Apers performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition), especially for scanned documents, to understand the structure and extract key information.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Distilling" type="status">
  Apers uses its AI capability to quickly read and understand the entire document.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Failed" type="status">
  The system failed to process the file.

  This can happen when the file type is not supported or if one of the processing steps failed. Click **Summarize** from the triple-dot icon (⋮) to restart the process.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ready" type="status">
  The file is fully processed. Apers understands the document, has compressed it, and completed OCR.
</ResponseField>
