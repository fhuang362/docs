The Criteria section lets you set the rules that deals must meet.

## Must-Pass Criteria

These are hard requirements. If a deal doesn't meet them, it fails the playbook evaluation.

**Examples:**
- Deal size must be greater than $10M
- Property must be built after 1980
- Occupancy must be above 85%

<Info>
  Must-pass criteria are pass/fail. A deal either meets them or it doesn't.
</Info>

## Return Targets

Set the financial thresholds for your strategy.

**Examples:**

| Metric | Target |
| ------ | ------ |
| Levered IRR | > 15% |
| IRR Floor | > 13% |
| Cash-on-Cash | > 8% |
| Equity Multiple | > 1.8x |

You can set both minimum thresholds (floors) and target ranges.

## How Criteria Work Together

When you deploy a playbook:

1. Apers checks all **must-pass criteria** first
2. If the deal passes, Apers evaluates it against your **return targets**
3. You get a clear view of how the deal scores against your strategy

<Info>
  Be specific with your criteria. The more precise you are, the better Apers can evaluate deals for you.
