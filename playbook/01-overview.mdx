Playbooks let you define your investment thesis in a structured way. Once created, you can deploy your playbook to evaluate any deal against your criteria.

## What is a Playbook?

A Playbook captures your investment strategy, including:

- What you're investing in and why
- Your target returns and financial thresholds
- Must-pass criteria for deals
- Property types and asset classes you prefer

## Why Use Playbooks?

|                              | Benefit                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**              | Evaluate every deal against the same criteria                  |
| **Speed**                    | Quickly screen deals without manual review                     |
| **Multiple Strategies**      | Create different playbooks for different approaches            |

## Create Multiple Playbooks

You can create as many playbooks as you need. Common ways to organize:

**By Asset Class:**
- Multifamily
- Logistics
- Data Centers
- Lodging

**By Risk Preference:**
- Core
- Core Plus
- Value Add
- Opportunistic

<Info>
  Each playbook is independent. You can deploy different playbooks to the same deal to see how it scores under different strategies.
