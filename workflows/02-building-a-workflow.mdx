Create custom workflows to automate your repetitive tasks.

## Creating a New Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Workflows">
    Click **Workflows** in the left side panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create New Workflow">
    A popup window will appear.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the details">
    Enter the workflow attributes (see below).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow Attributes

<ResponseField name="Name" type="required">
  Give your workflow a clear name so you can find it later.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Description" type="optional">
  Add details about what this workflow does.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Workflow Steps" type="required">
  The instructions Apers will follow. You can add multiple steps that run one after another.
</ResponseField>

## Adding Workflow Steps

Each step is an instruction for Apers to execute. Steps run in order, from first to last.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the text box">
    Click on a step's text box to edit it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your instruction">
    Type what you want Apers to do in this step. For example: "Summarize the rent roll" or "Calculate the cap rate."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add more steps">
    Click to add additional steps as needed. Each step runs after the previous one finishes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Input Requests

Sometimes you need information from the user before running a workflow. Input requests let you ask for this.

**Example:** A market research workflow might need to know which market to research.

When you add an input request:

1. Apers will ask the user for that information when the workflow runs
2. The user's answer is saved as a variable
3. You can use that variable in later steps

<Info>
  Once you create a variable, you can reuse it in any following step—no need to ask for the same information twice.
</Info>

## Using Variables in Later Steps

After creating an input request, you can reference that variable in any step that comes after.

**Example:**

- Step 1: Input request for "market_name"
- Step 2: "Research population growth in {{market_name}}"
- Step 3: "Find comparable sales in {{market_name}}"

The variable carries through the entire workflow.
